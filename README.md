description:
A webApp for enthusiastic home gardeners just starting out, who don't have a lot of time to babysit their plants or the requisite experience to get a good crop.

The app remembers details of your garden for you and sends you reminders when you need to do something. It gives recommended irrigation applications based on local climate data and warns you about incoming severe weather. Users can also choose to connect with each other to trade produce at harvest time!
